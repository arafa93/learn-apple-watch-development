# Learn Apple Watch Development
##### Learn how to build Apple Watch apps from scratch!

>This tutorial is still a _**Work in Progress**_ <br> so we would be grateful if you could _**help**_ us by <br>raising any [issues](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-apple-watch-development/issues/new) you may find.


Before we _dive_🏊‍ into development for Apple Watch, we need to learn the basics.

>**Swift** is the chosen language for development, If you come from a different <br> programming background like us, then we'd highly recommend going through the <br> fundamentals of swift [here](/basics-of-swift/README.md)
