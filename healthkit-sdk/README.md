# HealthKit SDK

##### The HealthKit SDK is built by Apple and will allow us to access health and fitness information from a user's device, whether it be an iPhone or an Apple Watch. The data is stored securely in a HealthKit Data Store, we'll be requiring access to this data store and then querying it to give us specific samples. i.e. the number of steps taken by the user.
