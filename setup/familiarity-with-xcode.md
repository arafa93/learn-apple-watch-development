* **Navigator**
    * Very useful for navigating around in the project🚥
* **Project Space**
    * Biggest screen real-estate to be used for code! 🙌
* **Utilities**
    * Used for viewing/managing file metadata (**File Inspector** 📁)
    * As well as for viewing details of what has been selected in the editor using tools such as
      * Attribute Inspector
      * Size Inspector
      * Object Library
    **TIP:** Spend some time getting use to the IDE and it's layout
