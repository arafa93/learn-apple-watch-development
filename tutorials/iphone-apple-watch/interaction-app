# Interactivity between an iPhone & Apple Watch

Now that we've build a few stand alone apps for both the iPhone and Apple Watch, <br>
It's time to build üë∑‚Äç something that will work on both devices!

Our first step would be to go about understanding how to connect iPhone to an Apple <br>
Watch, enter:
### [WatchConnectivity Framework](https://developer.apple.com/reference/watchconnectivity)
**Used to connect and relay messages in both directions between the two devices**

We'll be using the [classes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html) and [protocol](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html) provided by this framework to create a connection in our app.

#### Setup

##### Project
Create a Project (iOS App with WatchKit App)

##### Watch
Create a Button (style it as you wish) and connect it to the controller as an action

```js
@IBAction func buttonClicked() {
    print("Button Clicked!")
}
```

Next we need to use the WatchConnectivity framework to setup the Watch to be able to send and receive requests from the phone.

Firstly lets import `WatchConnectivity` and require it in the controller class
```js
import WatchConnectivity

class InterfaceController: WKInterfaceController, WCSessionDelegate {

public func session(_ session: WCSession, activationDidCompleteWith
activationState: WCSessionActivationState, error: Error?) {
  // leave empty
 }

 //rest of code
 }
```
As you can see above, we have a required method called `activationDidCompleteWith:error`, This is called when the activation of a method finishes


Next lets activate the `WCSession` that will establish a connection between the two devices
