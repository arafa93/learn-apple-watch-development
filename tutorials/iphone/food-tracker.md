# Food Tracker App

This tutorial will guide you through creating a Food Tracker app, it is based on the [Apple Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1) for developing iOS apps, I found the guide great to work with, but unfortunately it wasn't up to date with all the latest changes that have been made in **Swift v3.1**

Each section will build upon the previous one and eventually help you build an app that lets you view/edit/delete food that you may have eaten.

[Basic UI](#basic-ui)  

**Before we start you'll need to**
- create a new Xcode project(name it whatever you wish, FoodTracker might be a good)Â 
- It needs to be an iOS Single View application
- look through the files that Xcode has created for you to get yourself ready to dive in(especially ViewController.swift, Main.storyboard)
- open **Main.storyboard**

### Basic UI


##### Add an Input Field

- Add an input field (found in the Object Library)

  - Align the left and right edges of the text field until you see three vertical layout guides

  - In the Attributes inspector add a placeholder for the input `Enter meal name`
  - Also change the Return Key dropdown from `default` to `Done`
  - Also select the Auto-enabled Return Key checkbox

##### Add a Label

- Add a Label to the storyboard
  - Align it so that it is in line with the left side and above the text field

  - Edit the name of the label by double clicking it and changing it to `Meal Name`


##### Add a Button

- Add a Button to the storyboard
  - Align it so that it is in line with the left side and below the text field

  - Edit the name of the button by double clicking it and changing it to `Set Default Label Text`

##### Creating an Auto Layout

**Why:question:**
We want the design to be universal so that it works across all iOS devices from iPhone 5 to iPad Pro and this is one way to go about solving this issue.

- Select all items on the storyboard by pressing the shift key and selecting the text field, label and button.
- **Stack** the items together (groups them together either vertically or horizontally, Xcode is clever and will do this automatically)

  - You can view the stacked items in the outline view

- In the Attributes Inspector change the Spacing field to 12 (this will add space in between each element)
- **Pin** the stacked items to the boundaries by adding new constraints
  - Select the **Pin** menu

  - Add New Constraints to the left(0), right(0) and top(60) and select `Contrain to margins` checkbox

 - Select `Items of New Constraints` from the Update Frames dropdown and Add them

- Apply constraints to the left(0) and right(0) to the input field so that it stretches out (make sure that the input field has been selected)

- Also change the Intrinsic Size from `Default` to `Placeholder` in the Size Inspector

##### Run it in a simulator to see the Basic UI in action

**If you've come across any issues and are unable to get your code up and running then here is the [link to the XCode project](resources/FoodTracker) for this Tutorial.**
